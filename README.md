# Portfolio Draft (Static Site)

How to deploy on Netlify:
1) Drag this entire folder into Netlify's "Deploy site" area (or connect a repo).
2) Set build command to **none** (it's a static site).
3) Set publish directory to the site root (where `index.html` is).
4) Add your custom domain in Netlify domain settings.

Replace images in `assets/img/` and edit the page content in the `.html` files.
